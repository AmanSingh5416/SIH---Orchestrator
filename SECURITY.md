## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of HRMS - Orchestrator is a top priority. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email us at: **[Your Email Here]**

Include the following information in your report:

1. **Description** of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
3. **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
4. **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
5. **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to fix the vulnerability before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing or modifying other users' data
- Do not perform actions that could harm the availability of the service
- Only interact with accounts you own or have explicit permission to access

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for your accounts
2. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of the application
3. **Secure Environment**: Ensure your deployment environment is secure
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data to version control

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies updated to latest secure versions
4. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive configuration
5. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production environments

## Security Features

### Current Implementation

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs for secure password storage
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data protection
- **Rate Limiting**: (Recommended for production)

### Planned Security Enhancements

- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Session management improvements
- Enhanced input validation
- Security headers implementation
- Audit logging

## Security Checklist for Deployment

### Database Security
- [ ] MongoDB connection uses authentication
- [ ] Database access is restricted to application servers only
- [ ] Regular database backups are configured
- [ ] Database credentials are stored securely

### Application Security
- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] JWT secrets are strong and unique
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled for all communications
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Input validation is implemented on all endpoints

### Infrastructure Security
- [ ] Server firewall is properly configured
- [ ] Regular security updates are applied
- [ ] Access logs are monitored
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures are tested

## Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

### 1. SQL/NoSQL Injection
**Risk**: Malicious queries could access unauthorized data
**Mitigation**: We use Mongoose ODM with parameterized queries

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Risk**: Malicious scripts could be executed in user browsers
**Mitigation**: Input validation and output encoding implemented

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Risk**: Unauthorized actions could be performed on behalf of users
**Mitigation**: CORS configuration and token-based authentication

### 4. Authentication Bypass
**Risk**: Unauthorized access to protected resources
**Mitigation**: JWT middleware validates all protected routes

### 5. Information Disclosure
**Risk**: Sensitive information could be exposed
**Mitigation**: Error handling doesn't expose sensitive details

## Security Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

### Backend Dependencies
- `bcryptjs`: Password hashing
- `jsonwebtoken`: JWT token management
- `express`: Web framework with security best practices
- `cors`: Cross-origin resource sharing
- `mongoose`: MongoDB ODM with built-in protections

### Security Scanning

We recommend using the following tools for security scanning:

```bash
# Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
npm audit

# Fix vulnerabilities automatically where possible
npm audit fix

# Use npm-check-updates to keep dependencies current
npx npm-check-updates
```

## Incident Response Plan

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response** (0-1 hour)
   - Assess the scope and impact
   - Contain the incident if possible
   - Document the incident

2. **Investigation** (1-24 hours)
   - Identify the root cause
   - Determine affected systems and data
   - Implement temporary fixes

3. **Resolution** (1-7 days)
   - Develop and test permanent fixes
   - Deploy fixes to production
   - Monitor for additional issues

4. **Post-Incident** (1-2 weeks)
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security measures
   - Communicate with affected users
